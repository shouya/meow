nya is an adorable catgirl who lives in a wonderful world paralleled
with us called にじげん. She's cute, smart, and always curious about
the world she lives. "Ahhh? Nya-chan want to check its type nyaaa~" is
what she speak most.

nya, strictly speaking, is not a programming language. Because she
does not aim to be anything executable. In the other word, I didn't
even plan to write an evaluator for her.

nya is a field for me to carry out my own idea about how a
contract-based static type-checking system is like.

nya consists of a simple dynamic-typed language and a type system for
the language.

お楽しみに!
